## Automation framework
In this project I've created an framework for automation tests. It covers tests for Web browsers, Android devices and API calls. I've decided to divide it on 3 sections which are described below:

### Appium
- module which is responsible for Android automation tests,
- used technologies: Java + Appium + Cucumber,
- code is formatted with Page Object Pattern rules,
- 3 example scenarios are implemented.

### Karate
- module which is responsible for API automation tests,
- used technologies: Karate (uses automatically Gherkin syntax),
- 2 example scenarios are implemented.

### Selenium
- module which is responsible for Web automation tests.
- used technologies: Java + Selenium + Cucumber. 
- code is formatted with Page Object Pattern rules.
- there is availability to use Galen framework which is responsible to make layout check tests,
- 12 example Selenium scenarios are implemented.
- 1 example Galen scenario is implemented.
